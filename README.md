[Boston Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston)

Please download the datasets from above links and then extract them into a folder called **data**. You can also see the project structure shown below:

* Seattle and Boston AirBNB Data Analysis (**Project Main Folder**)
  * .vscode (**ignored** in _.gitignore_ file)
  * data
  * .gitignore (**ignored**)
  * airbnb-data-analysis.ipynb
  * LICENCE
  * README.md 

After you download and extract the datasets in the **data** folder, rename them as follows;

* For **Boston** csv files;
  * boston-calendar.csv
  * boston-listings.csv
  * boston-reviews.csv

* For **Seattle** csv files;
  * seattle-calendar.csv
  * seattle-listings.csv
  * seattle-reviews.csv

In this way, it is clearer.
